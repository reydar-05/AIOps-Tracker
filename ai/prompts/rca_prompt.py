    Build a strong, structured prompt for AI-based incident analysis.
    Output is strictly JSON — no prose, no markdown fences.

    Key prompt-engineering choices:
      - Logs are presented BEFORE alarm metadata (anchors AI on logs first).
      - Explicit instruction to QUOTE log content, not paraphrase the alarm.
      - Environment is reiterated in the instructions section to prevent the
        AI from inventing one ("dev"/"prod" hallucination).
      - Confidence is anchored to log clarity, not gut feeling.

Your job is to read the SYSTEM LOGS below and determine what happened.
Do NOT just paraphrase the alarm — the alarm tells you that something fired,
but the LOGS tell you why. Quote specific error keywords, exception names,
status codes, file paths, or stack-trace frames from the logs.

SYSTEM LOGS (sanitised, last 15 minutes — this is the PRIMARY source of truth):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{logs}

ALARM CONTEXT (secondary — use only to confirm what the logs already show):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alarm Name      : {alarm}
Alarm State     : {state}
Alarm Reason    : {reason}
Pre-classified  : {error_pre}
Environment     : {env}        <-- IMPORTANT: use this exact value, do not change it
Incident ID     : {payload.get('incident_id')}
Timestamp       : {payload.get('timestamp')}
Instance ID     : {payload.get('instance_id', 'N/A')}
ASG Name        : {payload.get('asg_name', 'N/A')}
Region          : {payload.get('region')}

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. PRIMARY TASK: Identify the actual error pattern in the logs above. Mention
   specific keywords from the logs in your "root_cause" and "summary" fields
   (e.g., NullPointerException, KeyError, OOMKilled, 502 Bad Gateway, port
   already in use, connection refused, etc.).
2. Classify severity based on:
     - Environment: {env} (prod >> staging >> dev for severity weighting)
     - User-facing impact (does the log mention customer impact, 5xx, downtime?)
     - Error pattern (FATAL/CRITICAL >> ERROR >> WARN >> INFO)
3. Set "confidence" to:
     - HIGH   — logs contain explicit, unambiguous error keywords
     - MEDIUM — logs partially explain the issue but require some inference
     - LOW    — logs are missing, generic, or do not match the alarm
4. List "affected_components" using AWS service names (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache,
   ALB, Lambda, EKS) plus any application components named in the logs.
5. "immediate_actions" must be 2-4 concrete, runnable steps (commands, API
   calls, console paths) — not vague advice.
6. The "environment" you reference must be exactly: {env}

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object — no prose, no markdown fences, no
explanation outside the JSON. Use exactly this structure:

{{
  "summary":          "One sentence stating what the LOGS show happened (not what the alarm fired about).",
  "root_cause":       "2-3 sentences. Quote specific error keywords/exception names from the logs.",
  "severity":         "CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "severity_reason":  "Why you chose this severity. Reference the environment ({env}) and impact.",
  "affected_components": ["list", "of", "AWS", "services", "and", "app", "components"],
  "immediate_actions": [
    "Concrete action 1 (command, console path, or API call)",
    "Concrete action 2"
  ],
  "long_term_fix":    "Architectural or config change that prevents recurrence.",
  "pattern_detected": true or false,
  "pattern_description": "Describe the pattern if true, otherwise null.",
  "confidence":       "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "estimated_impact": "User-facing impact in one sentence."
}}"""
